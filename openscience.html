<h3 id="openscience">Open Science</h3>

Sharing code, knowledge and data openly are fundamental to the
progress of science. In that spirit, I am involved in the development
of many open source toolboxes.

I am a core contributor to 
<a href="http://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html">MNE-Python</a>,
a software package for MEG and EEG data analysis.<br/>

I also co-developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for MEG.
It's a standard to enable easy data sharing between researchers. 
The <a href="https://mne-tools.github.io/mne-bids/">MNE-BIDS</a><br/>
package is a toolbox I maintain that helps achieve this goal.

I also maintain
<a href="https://github.com/glm-tools/pyglmnet/">pyglmnet</a>, a Python package
to fit regularized general linear models.
